I thought the blank page might be confusing to users, but it only shows up for a second. (Edit: For urls that open apps, it shows up much longer.) (We added a query-param that lets the client specify a a window title which displays inside the tab bar.)
            // - Autoclosing doesn't work when we're using the redirect-service from GitHub Markdown. 
            //  - I think it only works if the window hosting the redirect-service was opened by js or something? (That's what the messages in Safari console suggest.) (Update: Autoclosing does work when opening the links without js from ./test.html as of 04.09.2024)

            // Notes on postactions:

            //      (Amd if the user clicks cancel on the 'do you want to open this app' dialog, we also want to close/goback.)
            // - (as of 04.09.2024) We could not get this to work properly  but we built an approximation, that offers an ok UX. The problem is that there seems to be no API for detecting the point in time when the URL is opened, or when the 'Allow opening this app?' dialog is opened. 
            //      We could sort of approximate the timing of those things by monitoring the order and timing of certain events on the `document` and `window` such as 'blur', 'mouseover', and 'focus'. But we could not find anything that seemed robust. I didn't want to rely on the specific timing of the events as that feels 
            //      like it could easily change between machines and with updates. The order of events was promising, but the only approach we found for Safari broke when the user moves the cursor while the page is loading.
